# Summarising_Multivariate_Data_and_PCA

This project analysis of the air pollution data. For this project, we generate graphical and numerical summaries of the data for initial analysis, followed by data standardization. We then perform PCA on both the standardized and the non-standardized data. We interpret the principal components and determine the optimal number of principal components to use in this analysis using a scree plot. We further analyse the data by producing a scatter plot of the first principal component against the second.
